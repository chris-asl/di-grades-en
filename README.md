LaTeX Template for the Grades Certificate of DIT@UoA

The two files one needs to edit are `details.tex` and `gradeslist.tex`.

The first one contains the Department's and Student's information as displayed in the certificate.
The second one contains the grades that appear in the certificate.

To be able to compile the template you need `xelatex`, as well as the packages used by the class.

Special thanks to @ividim for fine tuning some details.
For any suggestion or if you find a bug, please email me: e.dona[at]di.
